					"Students in this course will learn about the use and design of modern
					operating systems, focusing on Linux. On the 'use' side, students
					will learn the Linux command line, to write shell scripts, and to
					build programs with GNU utilities like awk, sed, and make.
					On the 'design' side, students will develop a deep understanding of
					process management, memory management, file systems, and concurrency,
					and how they apply to modern technologies like virtualization and 
					cloud computing. "

				<h1> "Main takeaways"
				<p [ta:left]> "This course helped shed light on the many layers of abstraction
				that our modern operating systems are built upon. 
				Scheduling, multi-threaded concurency, persistence, and filesystem mechanics. 
				Our modern OS's manage quite a bit behind the scenes which allows us to seamlesly 
				browse, play, and create with ease."
